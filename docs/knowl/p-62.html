<p>There is no reason to think that the friendship graph is planar, so perhaps our answer depends on the actual friendships in the particular situation.  It turns out that it doesn't.  We haven't used all our information yet: no student is friends with more than three other students.  The number of edges coming out of a vertex is called the <dfn class="terminology">degree</dfn> of the vertex (a nicer way to say this is the the degree is the number of edges <dfn class="terminology">incident</dfn> to the vertex).  Later we will see that knowing about the degrees of vertices in a graph can tell us something about the chromatic number.</p>
