<p>We have seen that in general, there is no limit to how large the chromatic number of a graph can be.  In particular, the complete graph \(K_n\) (the graph with \(n\) vertices all of which are adjacent) has chromatic number \(\chi(K_n) = n\text{.}\)  However, a very early question in graph theory was whether every <em class="emphasis">planar</em> graph has chromatic number at most 4.  This is called the <em class="emphasis">Four Color Theorem</em>.  This theorem seems like it should be fairly easy to prove, but it took mathematicians a long time to prove it, and even today, the best proof we have requires a computer to check hundreds of cases.  Given the difficulty of this theorem, graph theorists have spent a lot of effort to understand chromatic number in many different ways.</p>
