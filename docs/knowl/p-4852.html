<p>Now look at pairs of edges.  No matter what two edges we pick, there will be \(k^4\) colorings in which both edges are violated.  For example, if we look at the edges \(e_1\) and \(e_2\text{,}\) then there are three vertices that we must worry about: \(v_1, v_2\) for \(e_1\) and \(v_2, v_3\) for \(e_2\text{.}\)  Whatever color we pick for \(v_1\) must be the same as \(v_2\text{.}\)  And then to satisfy \(e_2\text{,}\) we must make \(v_3\) the same color as well.  This gives \(k\) choices for these three vertices, and then \(k\) choices for <em class="emphasis">each</em> of the remaining \(3\) vertices.  However, if we pick \(e_1\) and \(e_3\text{,}\) now we have four vertices to worry about: \(v_1, v_2\) for \(e_1\) and \(v_3, v_4\) for \(e_3\text{.}\)  We don't need \(v_2\) and \(v_3\) to be the same, but still we find that there are \(k^4\) colorings.  One choice of \(k\) for \(v_1\) and \(v_2\text{,}\) another for \(v_3\) and \(v_4\text{,}\) and then choices for each of \(v_5\) and \(v_6\text{.}\)</p>
