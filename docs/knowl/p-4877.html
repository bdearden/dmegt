<p>A very natural way to reduce the size of a graph is to simply remove one of the edges.  If \(G\) is a graph and \(e\) is a specific edge in \(G\text{,}\) we write \(G-e\) for the graph in which \(e\) is removed from the set of edges.  We read \(G - e\) as “\(G\) delete \(e\)”.  Note that we are not changing the number of vertices here, even if one of the vertices in the edge has degree one in \(G\text{.}\)  In particular, it is possible that \(G\) is a connected graph but \(G-e\) is not.</p>
