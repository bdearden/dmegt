<p>Suppose you have some number of identical Rubik's cubes to distribute to your friends. Imagine you start with a single row of the cubes.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li>
<p>Find the number of different ways you can distribute the cubes provided:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>You have 3 cubes to give to 2 people.</p></li>
<li><p>You have 4 cubes to give to 2 people.</p></li>
<li><p>You have 5 cubes to give to 2 people.</p></li>
<li><p>You have 3 cubes to give to 3 people.</p></li>
<li><p>You have 4 cubes to give to 3 people.</p></li>
<li><p>You have 5 cubes to give to 3 people.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Make a conjecture about how many different ways you could distribute 7 cubes to 4 people. Explain.</p></li>
<li><p>What if each person were required to get <em class="emphasis">at least one</em> cube? How would your answers change?</p></li>
