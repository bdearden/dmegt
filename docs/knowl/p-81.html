<p>Some of the graphs we have seen in the examples above have the property that between any two vertices, there is at most one edge. Graphs like these are sometimes called <dfn class="terminology">simple graphs</dfn>.  When a graph is allowed to have more than one edge between vertices, we might call it a <dfn class="terminology">multigraph</dfn>.  We will decide later whether “graph” should always mean simple graph or can include multigraphs: this will be a consequence of the careful definition we choose.  Similarly, should we allow an edge to connect a vertex back to itself?  We might call a graph including these single edge loops a <dfn class="terminology">pseudograph</dfn>.</p>
