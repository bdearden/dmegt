<p>The answer is not \(k(k-1)^3 = P(P_3, k)\text{,}\) but only because some of the colorings of \(P_3\) have \(a\) and \(d\) colored the same.  Let's count how many proper colorings of \(P_3\) like that there are.  We have \(k\) colors to choose for \(a\) (and this color is the same as \(d\)).  Then there are \(k-1\) choices for the color of \(b\text{.}\)  What about \(c\text{?}\)  Well, we are only considering <em class="emphasis">proper</em> colorings of \(P_3\text{,}\) so \(c\) cannot be the same color as \(b\) or as \(d\) (and we know that \(d\) is the same color as \(a\)).  So there are only \(k-2\) colors to choose from for \(c\text{.}\)</p>
<p>Putting this all together we see that \(P(C_4, k) = k(k-1)^3 - k(k-1)(k-2)\text{.}\)  Note that the \(k(k-1)(k-2)\) bad colorings we remove are equal in number to the proper colorings of \(C_3\text{.}\)  This makes sense: by insisting that \(a\) and \(d\) are colored the same, it is like we are identifying those two vertices.  If you slide \(a\) and \(d\) together (removing the redundant edge between them) you get \(C_3\text{.}\)</p>
