<p>How do we know?  Consider this: if there were a graph with 25 vertices, all of degree 3, then how many edges would the graph have?  At first, we might guess 75, since each vertex is incident to three edges, so  \(3\cdot 25 = 75\text{.}\)  But we have counted every edge exactly twice, since each edge is incident to exactly two vertices.  So in fact, there would be \(75/2 = 37.5\) edges.  That cannot happen!</p>
