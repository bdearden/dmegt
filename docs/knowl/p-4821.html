<p>What about other classes of graphs?  There are some that are not too difficult (you are asked to describe the chromatic function for all trees in the exercises).  However, finding the chromatic function for many graphs can be quite challenging.  In the next few sections we will consider some techniques to overcome some of this challenge.  We conclude with one example of a small graph with a complicated chromatic function computation.</p>
