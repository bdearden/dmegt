<p>In <a href="sec_gt-intro.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.2: Graphs">SectionÂ 1.2</a>, we said a graph was <dfn class="terminology">connected</dfn> if there was a <em class="emphasis">path</em> between any two vertices in the graph.  A graph was a <dfn class="terminology">tree</dfn> if it was connected an contained no <em class="emphasis">cycles</em>.  What is a path and what is a cycle?</p>
<p>Intuitively, you can think of a path as the result of tracing over the edges of a graph, however it turns out that we will insist that you don't trace over any edge or vertex more than once.  A cycle then is just like a path except you stop where you started (and that is the only point where you can repeat a vertex).</p>
<p>Let's try to be more precise.  We will define a path and a cycle in terms of subgraphs!  Recall two of our named graphs: \(P_n\) and \(C_n\) are themselves paths and cycles (each with \(n\) edges).</p>

<p>A <dfn class="terminology">path in a graph \(G\)</dfn> is a subgraph of \(G\) isomorphic to \(P_n\) for some \(n\) (we say that \(n\) is the <dfn class="terminology">length</dfn> of the path).</p>
<p>We say that vertices \(u\) and \(v\) are <dfn class="terminology">on a path</dfn>, or that there is a <dfn class="terminology">path from \(u\) to \(v\)</dfn>, provided the subgraph isomorphic to \(P_n\) includes \(u\) and \(v\text{.}\)</p></article><article class="definition definition-like"><h6 class="heading">
