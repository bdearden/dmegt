<li><p>This is the set \(\{3, 4, 5, \ldots \}\) since we need each element to be a natural number whose square is at least three more than 2. Since \(3^2 - 3 = 6\) but \(2^2 - 3 = 1\) we see that the first such natural number is 3.</p></li>
<li>
<p>We get the same set as we did in the previous part, and the smallest non-negative number for which \(n^2 - 5\) is a natural numbers is 3.</p>
<p>Note that if we didn't specify \(n \in \N\) then any integer less than \(-3\) would also be in the set, so there would not be a least element.</p>
</li>
<li><p>This is the set \(\{1, 2, 5, 10, \ldots\}\text{,}\) namely the set of numbers that are the <em class="emphasis">result</em> of squaring and adding 1 to a natural number. (\(0^2 + 1 = 1\text{,}\) \(1^2 + 1 = 2\text{,}\) \(2^2 + 1 = 5\) and so on.) Thus the least element of the set is 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Now we are looking for natural numbers that are equal to taking some natural number, squaring it and adding 1. That is, \(\{1, 2, 5, 10, \ldots\}\text{,}\) the same set as the previous part. So again, the least element is 1.</p></li>
