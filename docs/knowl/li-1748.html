<p>You realize that the previous plan did not account for presentation. This time, you once again want to make 12 cookies, each one could be any one of the 10 types of cookies. However, now you plan to shape the cookies into the numerals 1, 2, â€¦, 12 (and probably arrange them to make a giant clock, but you haven't decided on that yet). How many choices do you have for which types of cookies to bake into which numerals? Explain.</p>
