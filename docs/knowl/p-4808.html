<p>The answer is not \(k(k-1)^3 = P(P_3, k)\text{,}\) but only because some of the colorings of \(P_3\) have \(a\) and \(d\) colored the same.  Let's count how many proper colorings of \(P_3\) like that there are.  We have \(k\) colors to choose for \(a\) (and this color is the same as \(d\)).  Then there are \(k-1\) choices for the color of \(b\text{.}\)  What about \(c\text{?}\)  Well, we are only considering <em class="emphasis">proper</em> colorings of \(P_3\text{,}\) so \(c\) cannot be the same color as \(b\) or as \(d\) (and we know that \(d\) is the same color as \(a\)).  So there are only \(k-2\) colors to choose from for \(c\text{.}\)</p>
