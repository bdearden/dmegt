<p>In the scenario above, we can use vertices to represent students, and use edges to represent friendships.  What should we make of the other information in the question?  We want to assign students to one of four rooms so that no room contains students who are friends.  Aha!  Let's color the vertices using the same rule as our map: adjacent vertices cannot be colored the same.  This insures that no two friends are the same room.  So we are asking: is the chromatic number of this graph no more than four?</p>
