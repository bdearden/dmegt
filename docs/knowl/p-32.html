<p>In an algebra or calculus class, you might have found a particular set of numbers (maybe the set of numbers in the range of a function). You would represent this set as an interval: \([0,\infty)\) is the range of \(f(x) = x^2\) since the set of outputs of the function are all real numbers 0 and greater. This set of numbers is NOT discrete. The numbers in the set are not separated by much at all. In fact, take any two numbers in the set and there are infinitely many more between them which are also in the set.</p>
