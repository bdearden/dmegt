<p>The way we resolve these decisions is by providing <em class="emphasis">definitions</em>.  These definitions will build off each other, and off of other definitions.  This is why we needed to wait until considering sets and functions: we will define a graph in terms of sets (and apply functions to graphs for other purposes).  Crafting good definitions is not easy, but it is incredibly important. The definition is the agreed upon starting point from which all truths in mathematics proceed. Is there a graph with no edges? We have to look at the definition to see if this is possible.</p>
