<p>Column A gives the colorings of \(G-e\) in which \(u\) and \(v\) are given the same color.  Now look at the proper colorings of \(G/e\text{.}\)  For each coloring in this list, we can assign vertices of \(G-e\) the same colors as they were assigned in \(G/e\text{,}\) except what to do for \(u\) and \(v\) that are the same new vertex in \(G/e\text{?}\)  Well assign \(u\) and \(v\) whatever color the new combined vertex was assigned.  This will still be a proper coloring of \(G-e\text{,}\) but one in which \(u\) and \(v\) have the same color.  In other words, the number of colorings in column A is precisely the number of proper colorings of \(G/e\text{.}\)</p>
