<p>We will want to say that the above graph is just one graph, that happens to have two <dfn class="terminology">connected components</dfn>.  There is good reason to allow non-connected graphs: in a computer network, it is natural to ask whether every computer is connected to every other.  You might even want some computers on their own component (if you are developing network hacking software and don't want to destroy the entire network by mistake).</p>
