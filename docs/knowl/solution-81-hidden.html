<body><div class="solution solution-like"><p>If we drew a graph with each letter representing a vertex, and each edge connecting two letters that were consecutive in the alphabet, we would have a graph containing two vertices of degree 1 (A and Z) and the remaining 24 vertices all of degree 2 (for example, \(D\) would be adjacent to both \(C\) and \(E\)). By Brooks' theorem, this graph has chromatic number at most 2, as that is the maximal degree in the graph and the graph is not a complete graph or odd cycle. Thus only two boxes are needed.</p></div></body>
