<p>Part (b) is the base case and part (a) is the inductive case. If on day 1 we have a number ending in a 5 (by part (b)), then on day 2 we will also have a number ending in a 5 (by part (a)). Then by part (a) again, we will have a number ending in a 5 on day 3. By part (a) again, this means we will have a number ending in a 5 on day 4</p>
<p>The proof by induction would say that on <em class="emphasis">every</em> day we will have a number ending in a 5, and this works because we can start with the base case, then use the inductive case over and over until we get up to our desired \(n\text{.}\)</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_logic-induction.html#Cwh">in-context</a></span>
