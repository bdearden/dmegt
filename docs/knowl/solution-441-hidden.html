<p>Consider the labeled \(P_3\) shown above. We have \(P(P_3, k) = k(k-1)^3\text{.}\)  This is because there are \(k\) choices for \(a\text{.}\)  Then there are \(k-1\) choices for \(b\text{.}\)  The next vertex in the path must be colored different from \(b\text{,}\) but could be colored the same as \(a\text{,}\) so there are still \(k-1\) choices for its color.  Similarly, there are \(k-1\) choices for the color of \(d\text{.}\)</p>
<p>On the other hand, \(P(C_3, k) = k(k-1)(k-2)\) (which is the same as \(P(k, 3)\text{,}\) where this \(P\) represents permutations).  There are \(k\) choices for \(a\text{,}\) then only \(k-1\) choices for \(b\) and then \(k-2\) choices for the last vertex, since it cannot be the same as either of the other two.</p>
