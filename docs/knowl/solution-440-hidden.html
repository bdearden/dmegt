<p>First let's find the chromatic functions for the paths on the left.  The top graph is \(P_1\text{,}\) and we have \(P(P_1, 2) = 2\) (since we can pick any of the two colors for \(a\text{,}\) and the other for \(b\)),        \(P(P_1, 3) = 6\text{,}\) and \(P(P_1, 4) = 12\) (there are 4 choices for \(a\) and 3 choices for \(b\)).</p>
<p>For the second path, \(P_2\text{,}\) we have \(P(P_2, 2) = 2\text{,}\)        \(P(P_2,3) = 12\text{,}\) and \(P(P_2, 4) = 36\text{,}\) since there are 4 colors to choose from for \(a\text{,}\) then three for \(b\) and three for \(c\text{.}\)</p>
<p>For \(P_3\text{,}\) we have \(P(P_3, 2) = 2\text{,}\)        \(P(P_3, 3) = 24\text{,}\) and \(P(P_3,4) = 108\text{.}\)</p>
<p>For \(C_3 = K_3\) (the triangle on the top right), we have \(P(K_3, 2) = 0\) (there are no proper colorings of \(K_3\) with 2 colors), \(P(K_3, 3) = 6\text{,}\) and \(P(K_3, 4) = 24\) (since there are 4 colors you can pick for \(a\text{,}\) 3 colors to choose from for \(b\) and 2 colors you can pick for \(c\)).</p>
<p>For \(K_4\text{,}\) we have \(P(K_4,2) = P(K_4,3) = 0\) and \(P(K_4,4) = 24\text{.}\)</p>
