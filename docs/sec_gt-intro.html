<p id="uFe">In the time of Euler, in the town of Königsberg in Prussia, there was a river containing two islands. The islands were connected to the banks of the river by seven bridges (as seen below). The bridges were very beautiful, and on their days off, townspeople would spend time walking over the bridges. As time passed, a question arose: was it possible to plan a walk so that you cross each bridge once and only once? Euler was able to answer this question. Are you?</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:10%;margin-right:10%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/gt-bridges-art.svg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div></div></div></article><p id="aMn">Graph Theory is a relatively new area of mathematics, first studied by the super famous mathematician Leonhard Euler in 1735. Since then it has blossomed in to a powerful tool used in nearly every branch of science and is currently an active area of mathematics research.</p>
<p id="GTw">The problem above, known as the <em class="emphasis">Seven Bridges of Königsberg</em>,  is the problem that originally inspired graph theory. Consider a “different” problem: Below is a drawing of four dots connected by some lines. Is it possible to trace over each line once and only once (without lifting up your pencil, starting and ending on a dot)?</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:40%;margin-right:40%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/gt-bridges-graph.svg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
<p id="naF">There is an obvious connection between these two problems. Any path in the dot and line drawing corresponds exactly to a path over the bridges of Königsberg.</p>
<p id="ThO">Pictures like the dot and line drawing are called <dfn class="terminology">graphs</dfn>. Graphs are made up of a collection of dots called <dfn class="terminology">vertices</dfn>  (singular: <dfn class="terminology">vertex</dfn>) and lines connecting those dots called <dfn class="terminology">edges</dfn>.  When two vertices are connected by an edge, we say they are <dfn class="terminology">adjacent</dfn>.  The nice thing about looking at graphs instead of pictures of rivers, islands and bridges is that we now have a mathematical object to study. We have distilled the “important” parts of the bridge picture for the purposes of the problem. It does not matter how big the islands are, what the bridges are made out of, if the river contains alligators, etc. All that matters is which land masses are connected to which other land masses, and how many times. </p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsec-gt-questions"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<a href="sec_gt-intro.html#subsec-gt-questions" class="permalink">¶</a><p id="p-49">Let's consider a few more typical problems about graphs, and the “real world” problems they help solve.  Along the way we will introduce a fair amount of vocabulary about graphs, which we will summarize at the end of the section.</p>
<p id="p-50">Graphs are useful in describing relationships between things.  The “things” might be numbers, or people, or cities, for example.  The relationships will be equally varied, but for now, we will insist that the relationships need to go both ways.  That is, if \(a\) is related to \(b\text{,}\) we need \(b\) to be related to \(a\text{.}\)</p>

</div></article><p id="p-55">A natural question to ask about the houses and utilities graph is whether it would be possible to draw the graph without edges crossing.  This would be a reasonable request, so that city planers don't have to worry about the utility lines interfering with each other.  Of course in reality, we have three dimensions to work with.  But consider a computer motherboard, which connects various important components with wires soldered to the board.  Can we connect the needed components without wires (literally) getting crossed?</p>
<p id="p-56">Graphs that can be drawn without edges crossing are called <dfn class="terminology">planar</dfn> (since they can be nicely drawn in the <em class="emphasis">plane</em>).  A common question in graph theory is to determine whether a particular graph is planar or not. Also of interest is to discover properties that are true of all planar graphs.</p>

Now coloring the map means coloring the vertices in such a way that adjacent vertices get different colors.  The smallest number of colors needed to color vertices in this way is called the <dfn class="terminology">chromatic number</dfn> of the graph.  Interestingly, knowing that a graph is planar limits what the chromatic number can be, and the graph we get from a map will generally be planar.</p>
<p id="p-59">Let's consider another real world application of graphs.</p>
<article class="question example-like" id="question-2"><h6 class="heading">
<span class="type">Question</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">1.2.4</span><span class="period">.</span>
</h6>
<p id="p-60">Professor Nefario has invited 25 unsuspecting discrete math students to his estate for an evening of escape room fun.  Some of these students are already friends, but no student is friends with more than three other students.  The Professor wants to ensure that no friends are sent to the same escape room.  Can he be sure that four escape rooms will be enough?</p></article><p id="p-61">In the scenario above, we can use vertices to represent students, and use edges to represent friendships.  What should we make of the other information in the question?  We want to assign students to one of four rooms so that no room contains students who are friends.  Aha!  Let's color the vertices using the same rule as our map: adjacent vertices cannot be colored the same.  This insures that no two friends are the same room.  So we are asking: is the chromatic number of this graph no more than four?</p>
<p id="p-62">There is no reason to think that the friendship graph is planar, so perhaps our answer depends on the actual friendships in the particular situation.  It turns out that it doesn't.  We haven't used all our information yet: no student is friends with more than three other students.  The number of edges coming out of a vertex is called the <dfn class="terminology">degree</dfn> of the vertex (a nicer way to say this is the the degree is the number of edges <dfn class="terminology">incident</dfn> to the vertex).  Later we will see that knowing about the degrees of vertices in a graph can tell us something about the chromatic number.</p>

<p id="p-63">Is it possible that among the 25 students, everyone has <em class="emphasis">exactly</em> three friends?</p></article><p id="p-64">Another way to ask the above question is this: is there a graph with 25 vertices in which every vertex has degree 3?  Let's answer this right now.  No.</p>
<p id="p-65">How do we know?  Consider this: if there were a graph with 25 vertices, all of degree 3, then how many edges would the graph have?  At first, we might guess 75, since each vertex is incident to three edges, so  \(3\cdot 25 = 75\text{.}\)  But we have counted every edge exactly twice, since each edge is incident to exactly two vertices.  So in fact, there would be \(75/2 = 37.5\) edges.  That cannot happen!</p>
<p id="bxh">In general, if we know the degrees of all the vertices in a graph, we can find the number of edges. The sum of the degrees of all vertices will always be <em class="emphasis">twice</em> the number of edges, since each edge adds to the degree of two vertices. Notice this means that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in any graph must be even!</p>
<p id="HEq">This is our first example of a general result about all graphs.  It seems innocent enough, but we will use it to prove all sorts of other statements.  So let's give it a name and state it formally.</p>

<p id="p-79">To fully answer <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/ques-four-vertex-count.html" title="Question 1.2.9">Question 1.2.9</a>, we will first need to be more careful about how we define graphs and what it means for two graphs to be “different.”  We will do this in <a href="sec_gt-carefully.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.5: Graphs Done Right">Section 1.5</a> after we consider sets and functions, the tools needed to give these careful definitions.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-2"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<a href="sec_gt-intro.html#subsection-2" class="permalink">¶</a><p id="p-80">Let's agree upon some more common terminology in discussing graphs and, in particular, particular types of graphs.</p>
<p id="p-81">Some of the graphs we have seen in the examples above have the property that between any two vertices, there is at most one edge. Graphs like these are sometimes called <dfn class="terminology">simple graphs</dfn>.  When a graph is allowed to have more than one edge between vertices, we might call it a <dfn class="terminology">multigraph</dfn>.  We will decide later whether “graph” should always mean simple graph or can include multigraphs: this will be a consequence of the careful definition we choose.  Similarly, should we allow an edge to connect a vertex back to itself?  We might call a graph including these single edge loops a <dfn class="terminology">pseudograph</dfn>.</p>
<p id="jbG">Must it always be possible to travel from any vertex in a graph to any other vertex along some sequence of edges?  If so, we say the graph is <dfn class="terminology">connected</dfn>.  A graph that is not connected might look like two separate graphs drawn close together. For example, the following graph is NOT connected because there is no path from \(a\) to \(b\text{:}\)</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:33.5%;margin-right:33.5%;"><div class="sbspanel" style="width:100%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img src="images/ex-gt-non-connected.svg" style="width: 100%; height: auto;" alt=""></div></div></div>
<p id="p-83">We will want to say that the above graph is just one graph, that happens to have two <dfn class="terminology">connected components</dfn>.  There is good reason to allow non-connected graphs: in a computer network, it is natural to ask whether every computer is connected to every other.  You might even want some computers on their own component (if you are developing network hacking software and don't want to destroy the entire network by mistake).</p>
<p id="PiP">What is the largest number of edges you can have in a (simple) graph? If we add all possible edges, then the resulting graph is called <dfn class="terminology">complete</dfn>.  That is, a graph is complete provided all vertices are adjacent.  Everyone is friends with everyone else. We give these a special name: \(K_n\)  is the complete graph on \(n\) vertices.</p>
<p id="vpY">Each vertex in \(K_n\) is adjacent to \(n-1\) other vertices, so the degree of each vertex is \(n-1\text{.}\)  The handshake lemma tells us how to find the number of edges:  the sum of the degrees is  \(n(n-1)\text{,}\) since we count \(n-1\) edges \(n\) times (once for each vertex).  This is twice the number of edges (since each edge is incident to 2 vertices, so we counted every edge exactly twice). Thus there are \(n(n-1)/2\) edges in \(K_n\text{.}\)</p>
<p id="p-86">What about the other extreme: how few edges can a graph with \(n\) vertices have?  That's easy.  Since we didn't say that graph had to be connected, the answer is zero!  What if the graph had to be connected?  We will answer this question in <a href="sec_trees.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.5: Trees">Section 2.5</a> when we study a special type of graph called a <dfn class="terminology">tree</dfn>.  For now, we can at least say what this is.</p>
<p id="p-87">We define a <dfn class="terminology">tree</dfn> to be a <em class="emphasis">connected</em> graph with no <em class="emphasis">cycles</em>.  What should a cycle be?  This is a bit hard to define at this point, but the name should give a good idea what it means.  Is it possible to put your pencil on some vertex and trace along edges, moving around the graph, until you eventually get back to where you started?  The “path” you traced out is a <dfn class="terminology">cycle</dfn> (strictly speaking, you must not have repeated any edges or vertices except your start/stop vertex).</p>
<p id="p-88">The name “tree” is a good one: if you draw a connected graph with no cycles, it might very well look a bit like a tree, with edges branching out.  Trees don't grow back in on themselves (that would be a cycle in the graph).  We extend this analogy: the vertices of degree one in a tree are called <dfn class="terminology">leaves</dfn>.</p>
<p id="p-89">If a graph contains no cycles but is not necessarily connected, we call the graph a <dfn class="terminology">forest</dfn>.  What is each connected component of a forest?  A tree!</p>
<p id="p-90">Some trees also get special names.  If the tree contains exactly two leaves and every other vertex has degree 2, then we call it a <dfn class="terminology">path</dfn>.  We use the notation \(P_n\) to denote the path with \(n\) <em class="emphasis">edges</em> (this means that \(P_n\) contains \(n+1\) vertices).  On the other extreme, if a tree contains only one non-leaf, we call it a <dfn class="terminology">star</dfn>, and use the notation \(S_n\) for the star with \(n\) leaves (so again, \(n+1\) vertices).</p>
<p id="p-91">There are lots of other amusingly named graphs: caterpillar graphs, jellyfish graphs, comb graphs, wheel graphs, snarks, butterfly graphs, claw graphs, daisy graphs, lollipop graphs, ladder graphs, and tadpole graphs.  Even better, there is nothing stopping you from defining a new sort of graph and discovering its properties.</p>
<p id="svs">One final definition: we say a graph is <dfn class="terminology">bipartite</dfn>  if the vertices can be divided into two sets, \(A\) and \(B\text{,}\) with no two vertices in \(A\) adjacent and no two vertices in \(B\) adjacent. The vertices in \(A\) can be adjacent to some or all of the vertices in \(B\text{.}\) If each vertex in \(A\) is adjacent to all the vertices in \(B\text{,}\) then the graph is a <dfn class="terminology">complete bipartite graph</dfn>, and gets a special name: \(K_{m,n}\text{,}\) where \(|A| = m\) and \(|B| = n\text{.}\) The graph in the houses and utilities puzzle is \(K_{3,3}\text{.}\)  Note: not all bipartite graphs are be \(K_{m,n}\text{;}\) those are only the complete bipartite graphs.</p>
