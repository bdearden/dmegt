  <exercise permid="nGV">
    <statement>
      <p permid="oFk">
        If 10 people each shake hands with each other,
        how many handshakes took place?
        What does this question have to do with graph theory?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution permid="hRJ">
      <p permid="uuw">
        This is asking for the number of edges in <m>K_{10}</m>.
        Each vertex (person) has degree
        (shook hands with)
        9
        (people).
        So the sum of the degrees is <m>90</m>.
        However, the degrees count each edge (handshake) twice,
        so there are 45 edges in the graph.
        That is how many handshakes took place.

  <exercise permid="TOe">
    <statement>
      <p permid="UMt">
        Among a group of 5 people,
        is it possible for everyone to be friends with exactly 2 of the people in the group?
        What about 3 of the people in the group?
      </p>
    </statement>
    <solution permid="NYS">
      <p permid="aBF">
        It is possible for everyone to be friends with exactly 2 people.
        You could arrange the 5 people in a circle and say that everyone is friends with the two people on either side of them
        (so you get the graph <m>C_5</m>).
        However, it is not possible for everyone to be friends with 3 people.
        That would lead to a graph with an odd number of odd degree vertices which is impossible since the sum of the degrees must be even.

  <exercise permid="zVn">
    <statement>
      <p permid="ATC">
        Is it possible for two <em>different</em>
        graphs to have the same number of vertices and the same number of edges?
        What if the degrees of the vertices in the two graphs are the same (so both graphs have vertices with degrees 1, 2, 2, 3, and 4, for example)?
        Draw two such graphs or explain why not.

        What is the largest number of edges possible in a graph with 10 vertices?  What is the largest number of edges possible in a <em>bipartite</em> graph with 10 vertices?  What is the largest number of edges possible in a <em>tree</em> with 10 vertices?

        The bipartite graph is a little tricky.  You will definitely want a complete bipartite graph, but it could be <m>K_{5,5}</m> or maybe <m>K_{1,9}</m>, or <ellipsis/>
