    Before we start studying graphs,
    we need to agree upon what a graph is.  		While we almost always think of graphs as pictures
    (dots connected by lines)
    this is fairly ambiguous.
    Do the lines need to be straight?
    Does it matter how long the lines are or how large the dots are?
    Can there be two lines connecting the same pair of dots?
    Can one line connect three dots?

  <p permid="cCA">
    The way we avoid ambiguities in mathematics is to provide concrete and rigorous <em>definitions</em>.
    Crafting good definitions is not easy,
    but it is incredibly important.
    The definition is the agreed upon starting point from which all truths in mathematics proceed.
    Is there a graph with no edges?
    We have to look at the definition to see if this is possible.

  <p permid="WNo">
    Back to some basic graph theory definitions.
    Notice that all the graphs we have drawn above have the property that no pair of vertices is connected more than once,
    and no vertex is connected to itself.
    Graphs like these are sometimes called <term>simple</term>,
    although we will just call them <em>graphs</em>.
    This is because our definition for a graph says that the edges form a set of 2-element subsets of the vertices.
    Remember that it doesn't make sense to say a set contains an element more than once.
    So no pair of vertices can be connected by an edge more than once.
    Also, since each edge must be a set containing two vertices,
    we cannot have a single vertex connected to itself by an edge.
  </p>

  <p permid="CUx">
    That said, there are times we want to consider double
    (or more)
    edges and single edge loops.
    For example,
    the <q>graph</q> we drew for the Bridges of Königsberg problem had double edges because there really are two bridges connecting a particular island to the near shore.
    We will call these objects <term>multigraphs</term>.
        <idx><h>multigraph</h></idx>
    This is a good name: a <em>multiset</em>
    is a set in which we are allowed to include a single element multiple times.
  </p>

  <p permid="jbG">
    The graphs above are also <term>connected</term>:
        <idx><h>connected</h></idx>
    you can get from any vertex to any other vertex by following some path of edges.
    A graph that is not connected can be thought of as two separate graphs drawn close together.
    For example,
    the following graph is NOT connected because there is no path from <m>a</m> to <m>b</m>:

    Vertices in a graph do not always have edges between them.
    If we add all possible edges,
    then the resulting graph is called <term>complete</term>.
        <idx><h>complete graph</h></idx>
    That is, a graph is complete if every pair of vertices is connected by an edge.
    Since a graph is determined completely by which vertices are adjacent to which other vertices,
    there is only one complete graph with a given number of vertices.
    We give these a special name: <m>K_n</m>

    <notation>
      <usage>K_n</usage>
      <description>the complete graph on <m>n</m> vertices</description>
    </notation>

    is the complete graph on <m>n</m> vertices.
  </p>

  <p permid="vpY">
    Each vertex in <m>K_n</m> is adjacent to <m>n-1</m> other vertices.
    We call the number of edges emanating from a given vertex the
    <term>degree</term> of that vertex.
    So every vertex in <m>K_n</m> has degree <m>n-1</m>.
    How many edges does <m>K_n</m> have?
    One might think the answer should be <m>n(n-1)</m>,
    since we count <m>n-1</m> edges <m>n</m> times
    (once for each vertex).
    However, each edge is incident to 2 vertices,
    so we counted every edge exactly twice.
    Thus there are <m>n(n-1)/2</m> edges in <m>K_n</m>.
    Alternatively, we can say there are <m>{n \choose 2}</m> edges,
    since to draw an edge we must choose 2 of the <m>n</m> vertices.
  </p>

  <p permid="bxh">
    In general, if we know the degrees of all the vertices in a graph,
    we can find the number of edges.
    The sum of the degrees of all vertices will always be
    <em>twice</em> the number of edges,
    since each edge adds to the degree of two vertices.
    Notice this means that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in any graph must be even!

        If such a graph existed,
        the sum of the degrees of the vertices would be <m>9\cdot 7 = 63</m>.
        This would be twice the number of edges (handshakes) resulting in a graph with <m>31.5</m> edges.
        That is impossible.
        Thus at least one
        (in fact an odd number)
        of the mathematicians must have shaken hands with an <em>even</em>
        number of people at the seminar.

  <p permid="gha">
    We can generalize the previous example to get the following proposition.<fn>A <term>proposition</term> is a general statement in mathematics, similar to a theorem, although generally of lesser importance.</fn> 
  </p>
  
  <proposition xml:id="prop-evensum" permid="YJF">
    <statement>
      <p permid="lms">
        In any graph, the number of vertices with odd degree must be even.

    </statement>
    <proof permid="rxd">
      <p permid="Ffj">
        Suppose there were a graph with an odd number of vertices with odd degree.  Then the sum of the degrees in the graph would be odd, which is impossible, by the handshake lemma.

    We will consider further applications of the handshake lemma in the exercises.

    One final definition: we say a graph is <term>bipartite</term>
        <idx><h>bipartite</h></idx>
    if the vertices can be divided into two sets, <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>,
    with no two vertices in <m>A</m> adjacent and no two vertices in <m>B</m> adjacent.
    The vertices in <m>A</m> can be adjacent to some or all of the vertices in <m>B</m>.
    If each vertex in <m>A</m> is adjacent to all the vertices in <m>B</m>,
    then the graph is a <term>complete bipartite graph</term>,
    and gets a special name:
    <m>K_{m,n}</m>, where <m>|A| = m</m> and <m>|B| = n</m>.
